This application was created to minimize the time people spend on finding a place to eat. Our application generates a random restaurant based on the user's location and preferences regarding price, distance, and food categories. It also allows a user to save restaurants and view them later on.

This is our [web application](https://kaylamchea.github.io/project-kaylamchea/).
