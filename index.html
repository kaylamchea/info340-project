        <h2>Topic Description</h2>
        <p>
            We are interested in creating a web application that helps people figure out what their next meal will be
            and
            where it will come from. We believe this topic is important because of multiple reasons. One reason is,
            based on our personal experience, it can be really challenging to figure out where and what to eat if you
            and/or your friends are indecisive. This seems to be a fairly common problem among the public too. If you
            Google something similar to “figuring out where to eat” there are a bunch of articles that pop up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason why we believe this topic should be addressed is people may want to try out a new restaurant
            without the hassle of reading a bunch of reviews and/or researching restaurants. There doesn’t seem to be
            any major application that recommends you a new place to eat based on your preferences. This situation also
            applies to people touring Seattle, or any city in Washington, without any locals to help them out. They
            could read articles about the best places to eat and figure out which place to try out. But they should also
            have the option of having a place chosen for them to eat.
        </p>
        <p>
            If one does not want to go out to eat and would prefer cooking something in the comfort of their own home,
            we want to help the user figure out how creative and interesting meals can be made at home without much
            effort. We want to assist the user in how they would cook something as well as what ingredients they would
            need. We also want to be able to offer an easier and quicker way to get all these ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, in our mission to help the community, we want to be able to help people with food insecurity. Food
            insecurity is a huge problem and we want to create a web app to address this issue and help the people in
            need.

        <h2>Potential Web Applications</h2>
        <p>
            One potential application is a website that recommends a restaurant based on a user’s location and
            preferences (cost, type of meal, type of cuisine, etc.). The overarching goal of our application is to
            reduce the time and energy people spend on deciding where to eat. The application would allow users to
            learn more about the recommended restaurant, such as it’s address, opening times, reviews, etc. Users
            would interact with our application by putting their location and preferences into the filter. Users
            would then swipe through the recommended places until they find one they like.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another potential application is a website that recommends you recipes based on what ingredients you
            have or allows you to browse recipes that match your preferences (e.g. how much time you have to cook).
            For each recipe, the ingredients would have links to Amazon Fresh and a map of nearby groceries that
            have the ingredients. The overarching goal of our application is to make it easier for people to cook
            homemade food. Our application would allow users to learn how to make the recipe by reading the steps or
            watching a tutorial. Users would interact with our application by filtering for relevant recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our last idea is a website that indicates where free or discounted food is being offered. The
            overarching goal of our website is to help people suffering from food insecurity find places to get a
            free, or more affordable, meal. Our application would allow users to learn about nearby places that
            provide free food and other resources. Users would interact with the application by putting in their
            location and indicating what times they are available and what food they would prefer.
